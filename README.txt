Small project designed to check on completion status of games.
Games are in an array, when yes is clicked, it is removed from Array, you can also add new games. 
Obviously not permanent changes currently. 

Currently not complete because I can't figure out the main feature which would be that if you click yes,
remove then next, or click no, next, where the answer can change at anytime in the list.

Update Log: Made some progress on the Yes and No buttons. Added the Add button with visibility changing on
text box and submit button, add whatever is typed in to the array.
